# Full-Stack Course Projects

This repository contains my structured .NET full-stack development projects completed as part of my ongoing course. 

## Overview

- Projects cover backend development, Blazor front-end integration, and full-stack problem-solving exercises.
- Each project is organized in its own folder.
- The repository includes main submissions and a few practice projects for learning and experimentation.
- Iterations and tinkering files exist; the main files for each project are in the respective project folder.

## Key Projects

- **EventEase** – Main submission demonstrating Blazor components and backend integration.
- **Project Reviews** – Examples of code review exercises and smaller projects used for practice.
- **Other Projects** – Organized under folders according to module/topic (HTML/CSS/JS, Intro to .NET, Blazor).

## Notes

- This repository is linked as a submodule in my [portfolio repository](https://github.com/WKrugerDev/WernerKruger-Portfolio) to showcase progress while keeping the portfolio clean.
- Regularly updated as I continue the course and add new projects.
